# Professional Static Site Skeleton Assessment

## Summary
- The repository already reads as a coherent Hugo starter with clean config, content scaffolding, and a minimal custom theme.
- Suitable for launching a professional static site once real copy replaces the placeholders.

## Strengths
- Clear Hugo layout: archetypes for posts/people, data-driven company and compliance blocks, and a tidy `_default` plus partials structure in `themes/atomic-core/`.
- Theme CSS is lightweight, responsive, and uses a neutral finance palette that is easy to retheme.
- Config defaults cover SEO basics (canonical, sitemap, robots), disable third-party trackers, and wire menu/navigation correctly.
- README documents commands and extension paths; `.gitignore` excludes generated artifacts.

## Gaps
- `themes/atomic-core/layouts/shortcodes/lead.html` is corrupted with control characters, so `{{< lead >}}` will fail.
- Nav links render raw `.URL`; use `.URL | relLangURL` (or `absLangURL`) before enabling multilingual.
- `.skip-link` lacks a `:focus` treatment, so keyboard users cannot access it.
- Hero copy is hard-coded in `themes/atomic-core/layouts/index.html`; move it to content front matter or data for editors.

## Next Steps
1. Rewrite the lead shortcode, fix skip-link focus styles, and run `hugo --panicOnWarning`.
2. Relocate hero strings into content/data and confirm menus/localization via `hugo server -D`.
