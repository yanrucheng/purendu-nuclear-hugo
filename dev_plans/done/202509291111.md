# Home Page Card Consistency Plan

## Goal
Align the three home page cards (Philosophy, Team, News) so they present information with a consistent structure, typography, and CTA treatment while preserving localized content.

## Current Gaps
- Markup differences: Philosophy card lists bullet items, while Team/News cards rely on paragraph text, creating uneven height and spacing.
- Data mismatch: `data/homepage.*.yaml` uses different fields per card (items vs. subtitle/description), complicating localization and future updates.
- Styling inconsistencies: cards render varying text styles and spacing because the template lacks modifiers for list vs. paragraph content; CTA labels also differ (`Learn More` vs. `View All`).

## Proposed Tasks
1. **Unify card data schema** – Update `data/homepage*.yaml` to give each card shared keys (e.g., `summary`, optional `items`, shared `cta` object) so translations stay aligned.
2. **Refactor home card markup** – Adjust `themes/atomic-core/layouts/index.html` (or extract a partial) so each card renders headings, summary text, optional bullet list, and CTA consistently; ensure list rendering only appears when data supplies items.
3. **Standardize CTA copy & styles** – Define consistent button/link classes in the template and, if needed, add a BEM-style modifier in `themes/atomic-core/static/css/main.css` for cards.
4. **Regression audit** – Run `hugo server -D` to review responsive behavior across locales; follow with `hugo --panicOnWarning` to confirm a clean build.

## Open Questions
- Should the Philosophy bullet points remain as a list, or convert to sentences to match the other cards?
- Is there stakeholder-preferred CTA language (e.g., keep `View All` for News)?
