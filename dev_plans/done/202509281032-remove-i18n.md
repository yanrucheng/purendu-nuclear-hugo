# Remove i18n temporarily for English-only build

## Context
- Current Hugo setup enables English, Simplified Chinese, and French via language config, localized data, and translation strings under `i18n/`.
- Templates pull localized strings with `i18n` and data files keyed by language codes; navigation uses language-specific menus.
- Goal is to run the site in English only while keeping the multi-language scaffolding easy to re-enable later.

## Tasks
1. Update configuration to disable non-English languages, set canonical params/menus to English defaults, and ensure URLs no longer use the `/en/` subdirectory.
2. Simplify data/content fallbacks so English data renders without relying on translation helpers, leaving other language resources untouched but inactive.
3. Refactor layouts and partials to replace `i18n` lookups with static English copy or data-driven values, preserving markup hooks (e.g., language switcher container) for future localization.
4. Run a Hugo build with warnings enabled to confirm the single-language setup works cleanly.

## Notes
- Keep existing `i18n/*.toml` and non-English content/data files for future use, but they should not be referenced by templates after the refactor.
- Avoid deleting language switcher markup; consider conditionally hiding it when only one language is available.
