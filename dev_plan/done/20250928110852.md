# Localization Regression Fix Plan

## Context
Recent visual refinements removed language-aware data lookups in key partials, causing localized pages (fr, zh-cn) to fall back to English content and incorrect `<link rel="alternate">` metadata.

## Tasks
1. Reinstate locale-sensitive data fetching in `themes/atomic-core/layouts/index.html` so the homepage pulls `Site.Data.homepage` entries for the active language with fallback support.
2. Restore localized company/compliance references in `themes/atomic-core/layouts/partials/footer.html`, ensuring multilingual disclaimers and contacts render correctly.
3. Rework `themes/atomic-core/layouts/partials/head.html` to derive localized company metadata and output dynamic `<link rel="alternate">` tags for every translation.
4. After code updates, rebuild with `hugo --panicOnWarning` and manually spot-check translated routes (`/fr/`, `/zh-cn/`) for footer, hero, and metadata accuracy.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Add a lightweight template helper partial for language fallback logic to keep future changes consistent.
- Consider integrating automated smoke tests (e.g., script to curl localized URLs) to detect future regressions.
