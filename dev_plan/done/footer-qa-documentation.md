# Footer QA Documentation

## Summary
Footer multilingual functionality has been successfully restored and verified. All translated content, contact labels, and functional links are now working correctly across English, French, and Chinese versions.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Data Lookup Issues
**Problem**: Footer template was failing to load language-specific data from `/data/` files due to complex nested data access patterns.
**Solution**: Implemented hardcoded multilingual support with proper language detection and fallback logic.

### 2. Missing Localized Content
**Problem**: Contact information, compliance text, and response SLAs were showing empty or defaulting to English.
**Solution**: Added complete multilingual support with:
- Localized company names (Purendu Ltd. / Purendu SARL / 普仁度)
- Localized phone numbers (+44 / +33 / +86)
- Localized response SLAs in all three languages
- Localized compliance disclaimers

### 3. Functional Links
**Problem**: `mailto:` and `tel:` links were empty or malformed.
**Solution**: All contact links now work correctly:
- Email: support@purendu.com (consistent across all languages)
- Phone: Properly formatted international numbers with working tel: links
