# Professional Visual Refresh Plan

## Objectives
- Present a more polished, institutional visual tone across layouts while keeping Hugo structure intact.
- Resolve footer alignment and spacing defects so contact/compliance blocks align consistently on all breakpoints.
- Improve consistency of typography, spacing, and reusable components to simplify future maintenance.

## Investigation Notes
- Footer currently uses three uneven grid columns (`themes/atomic-core/static/css/main.css`) causing misalignment on small and medium widths; content blocks mix paragraph lengths.
- Layout partials (`themes/atomic-core/layouts/partials/*.html`) rely on a single `container` class without vertical rhythm helpers.
- Homepage cards in `layouts/index.html` render unordered list & paragraphs without shared component styling, making them visually disjointed.
- Data for company/compliance spans multiple locales under `data/`; ensure design changes respect localization.

## Work Plan
1. **Establish visual baseline & references**
   - Run `hugo server -D` to capture current footer/header/homepage screenshots for comparison.
   - Inventory typography scales, spacing, and color usage in `themes/atomic-core/static/css/main.css`.

2. **Refine global layout scaffolding**
   - Introduce consistent spacing utilities (e.g., section padding, vertical rhythm) in `main.css` and apply in `layouts/_default/baseof.html`, `layouts/index.html`, and `_default` templates.
   - Evaluate need for a `.section` wrapper or utility partial to keep content widths/spacing consistent across pages.

3. **Footer realignment & content hierarchy**
   - Restructure `themes/atomic-core/layouts/partials/footer.html` to use flexbox or CSS grid with clear column sizing and stack rules.
   - Update footer styles in `main.css` to balance typography (muted text, line-height) and ensure centered alignment on narrow viewports.
   - Confirm localized data renders without breaking layout (check `.Site.Data.compliance` fallback paths).

4. **Homepage visual polish**
   - Harmonize card styling in `layouts/index.html` with consistent heading/body spacing, optional icons or accent dividers.
   - Consider elevating CTA button hierarchy (hover states, accessible contrast) and adjust `.hero` section spacing for professional tone.

5. **Typography and component refinements**
   - Define a type scale (e.g., `--font-lg`, `--font-sm`) in `:root` and apply to headings, body text, metadata.
   - Review buttons, navigation, and language switcher for alignment and focus states; extend CSS to cover hover/focus outlines.

6. **Responsive & cross-page QA**
   - Verify `strategy`, `team`, `news` layouts inherit new spacing without regressions.
   - Run `hugo --panicOnWarning` to confirm templates remain warning-free.
   - Document screenshots for desktop/tablet/mobile after updates.

## Deliverables
- Updated theme partials and `main.css` with clarified structure, comments where complex.
- QA notes and screenshots demonstrating footer alignment and overall visual improvements.
- List of manual checks performed (local build commands, responsive breakpoints).
