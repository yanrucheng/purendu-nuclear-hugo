# English Content Audit & Fallback Alignment

## Context
- Default rendering language is English (`config/_default/hugo.toml`), but shared data fallbacks still contain Simplified Chinese copy (`data/company.yaml:4`, `data/homepage.yaml:2`). When a language-specific file is missing these fallbacks surface on the English build.
- Homepage localization data uses different key shapes across languages (e.g., `cta_primary` vs. `cta.primary`), increasing the risk of mixed-language output during fallback logic in `themes/atomic-core/layouts/index.html`.
- Footer uses full-width punctuation in the contact line (`themes/atomic-core/layouts/partials/footer.html:14`), which shows up on English pages.

## Proposed Tasks
1. **Normalize English Defaults** — Rewrite the base data fallbacks (`data/company.yaml`, `data/homepage.yaml`, plus any other shared data) in English and mirror schema with the `*.en.yaml` files so accidental fallbacks remain fully English while preserving localized variants for future enablement.
2. **Unify Homepage Schema** — Align localized homepage data structures (EN/FR/ZH) to a common shape and adjust `themes/atomic-core/layouts/index.html` to reference generic keys (e.g., `hero.cta.primary`) to avoid conditional logic per language and keep multi-language readiness intact.
3. **Clean Layout Copy** — Replace non-ASCII punctuation and hard-coded text in templates with English-first strings or parameterized values (e.g., update the footer contact separator to `|`, confirm other partials rely on params/i18n rather than baked-in Chinese commentary).
4. **Repository Hygiene** — Translate or duplicate key docs (e.g., `README.md`) into English to match the product stance, and move Chinese guidance into a localized developer doc if needed so onboarding materials stay consistent with the rendered site.

## Validation
- Run `hugo --panicOnWarning` to confirm the site builds cleanly with standardized data.
- Manually review the homepage and key sections under `hugo server -D` to ensure all visible text is English and punctuation renders as expected.
- Spot-check language switcher visibility and translation fallbacks remain neutral until future localization work resumes.
