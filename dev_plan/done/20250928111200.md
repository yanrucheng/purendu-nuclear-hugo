# Footer QA Follow-up

## Context
Footer contact section realigned to right column with localized data restored. Need to capture verification steps and documentation tasks.

## Tasks
1. Manually review `/fr/` and `/zh-cn/` pages in the built site (or via `hugo server -D`) to ensure translated compliance text, contact labels, and `mailto`/`tel` links render correctly.
2. Take updated footer screenshots for desktop and mobile breakpoints to document the layout improvement.
