title: "Strategy"
description: "Methodology and risk control first, focusing on ore-forming geology, supply chain, and long-term value."

### Investment Philosophy
- Verifiability of ore-forming systems and mining-metallurgical methods.
- Key nodes and risk control in supply chain and fuel cycle.
- Governance and ESG practices for African projects.

### Research Pillars (Examples)
1. Ore-forming systems and source-sink: geochemistry/geophysics/tectonic evolution.
2. African geological belt focus: Sahara inland basins, Precambrian basement, etc.
3. Exploration methodology: sequence stratigraphy, remote sensing/spectroscopy, anomaly identification.
4. Data and verification: transparent records of samples, sections, and laboratory analyses.
